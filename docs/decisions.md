# Decision log

Format: `## <date> — <decision>`, then *Chose* / *Rejected* / *Why*.

## 2026-11-06 — uv for environment and dependency management
*Chose:* uv (project env, lockfile, `uv run`).
*Rejected:* pip + venv.
*Why:* One tool gives a reproducible lockfile, fast installs and pinned Python versions, with no manual venv activation.

## 2026-11-06 — Python 3.12 over 3.14
*Chose:* Python 3.12.
*Rejected:* Python 3.14.
*Why:* Google ADK, LiteLLM, and their native dependencies are most reliably tested on 3.12; newest Python risks missing wheels.

## 2026-11-06 — src layout
*Chose:* `src/eduagent/` package layout.
*Rejected:* flat layout with the package at the repo root.
*Why:* Tests must import the installed package, not the working directory, which catches packaging mistakes early.

## 2026-11-06 — Dependencies added per plan, not up-front
*Chose:* Add each dependency in the plan that first uses it (Chroma, MCP, Playwright, parsers later).
*Rejected:* Installing everything the spec mentions on day one.
*Why:* Keeps the environment small and every dependency justified by real code that needs it.

## 2026-11-06 — pydantic-settings + .env for configuration
*Chose:* pydantic-settings `Settings` class reading environment variables and a git-ignored `.env`.
*Rejected:* A YAML config file.
*Why:* Typed, validated values (bad `ROUTING_MODE` fails fast), secrets stay in `.env` out of git, and no extra parser or file format is needed.

## 2026-11-06 — No Gemini key means all-Qwen, not a crash
*Chose:* `effective_routing_mode` returns `all_qwen` when the key is missing or blank.
*Rejected:* Raising an error at startup when `ROUTING_MODE` needs Gemini but no key exists.
*Why:* The app must stay usable fully offline with local Qwen; a blank `GEMINI_API_KEY=` line in `.env` counts as no key.
